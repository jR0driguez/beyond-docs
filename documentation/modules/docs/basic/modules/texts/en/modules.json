They are the ones who are in charge of analyzing the dependency tree, removing those elements that are not in the code, and generating a \"bundle\" that is in turn, a container of all the modules used by the development team.",

      "p6": "The aforementioned structure allows the concept of modules used in BeyondJS to be closer to the definition used in computing in general, where it represents a functionality within a program or system. Although javascript modules are compatible with this concept, in practice a module of a project, application or library contains a series of javascript modules (internal modules in BeyondJS), together with the rest of the tools and technologies that are required to compose it, such as styles, images or text.",
